#+TITLE: Extract package files from RPM
#+FILETAGS: :howto:linux:fedora:package-manager:dnf:
#+INCLUDE: "_include.org"

* 
  ~dnf~ & ~repoquery~ don't provide ready faculties for extracting a file from a RPM package. You can do so without installing third-party software with ~rpm2cpio~ and ~cpio~, which are distributed with Fedora Workstation & RHEL.
  
  #+begin_src shell
#!/bin/bash

dnf_extract() {
    pkg="${1?Must supply package name}"
    file="${2?Must supply file path}"
    tmpdir="$(mktemp -d)"
    mkdir -p "$tmpdir"
    (
        cd "$tmpdir" || exit 3
        pkgname=$(dnf download --downloadonly "$pkg" --destdir="$tmpdir" \
                      | tee >(grep -o '[^[:space:]]*.rpm') 1>&2)
        rpm2cpio "$pkgname" | cpio -icvd "*$file"
        cat "${file:1}"
    )
    rm -r "$tmpdir"
}
  #+end_src

  Which can be called with the package name and absolute file path:
  
  #+begin_example
  $ dnf_extract bash-5.0.7-1.fc30.x86_64 /usr/share/licenses/bash/COPYING
  #+end_example
