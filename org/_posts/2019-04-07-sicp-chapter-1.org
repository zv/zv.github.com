Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are
compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the
following procedure:

        (define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
          ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is
faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He
defines the following two procedures:

          (define (p) (p))

          (define (test x y)
            (if (= x 0)
                0
                y))

Then he evaluates the expression

          (test 0 (p))

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order
evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses
normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule
for the special form `if' is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or
applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result
determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)
#+END_VERSE

*** Answer
#+BEGIN_VERSE
An applicative order evaluator would never terminate. The value of `p' is
expanded prior to the logic of `test' being applied.

Conversely, a normal-order evaluator would return 0, it never had the chance to
expand `p'

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why `if' needs to be provided as a special form.
"Why can't I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of `cond'?" she
asks. Alyssa's friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she
defines a new version of `if':

         (define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
           (cond (predicate then-clause)
                 (else else-clause)))

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

        (new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
        5

        (new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
        0

Delighted, Alyssa uses `new-if' to rewrite the square-root program:

        (define (sqrt-iter guess x)
          (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
                  guess
                  (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                            x)))

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square
roots?  Explain.
#+END_VERSE

*** Answer
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Any function supplied to `new-if' will be applied, `sqrt-iter' will thus infinitely loop.
#+END_QUOTE
** 1.7
#+BEGIN_VERSE
The `good-enough?' test used in computing square roots will not be very
effective for finding the square roots of very small numbers. Also, in real
computers, arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited
precision. This makes our test inadequate for very large numbers. Explain these
statements, with quotes showing how the test fails for small and large
numbers.

An alternative strategy for implementing `good-enough?' is to watch how
`guess' changes from one iteration to the next and to stop when the change
is a very small fraction of the guess. Design a square-root procedure that
uses this kind of end test. Does this work better for small and large
numbers?
#+END_VERSE

*** Answer
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (fix/sqrt-iter guess last-guess x)
  (let ([good-enough? (< (abs (- guess last-guess)) 0.001)]
        [next-guess (average guess (/ x guess))])
    (if good-enough? guess
        (fix/sqrt-iter next-guess guess x))))

#+END_SRC
** 1.8
#+BEGIN_VERSE
Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an
approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given
by the value

                x/y^2 + 2y
                ----------
                    3

Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the
square-root procedure. (In section 1.3.4 we will see how to implement
Newton's method in general as an abstraction of these square-root and
cube-root procedures.)

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two
positive integers in terms of the procedures `inc', which increments its
argument by 1, and `dec', which decrements its argument by 1.

          (define (+ a b)
            (if (= a 0)
              b
              (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

          (define (+ a b)
            (if (= a 0)
              b
             (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each
procedure in evaluating `(+ 4 5)'. Are these processes iterative or
recursive?
#+END_VERSE

*** Answer
#+BEGIN_VERSE

The first is recursive:

  scheme@(guile-user)> ,trace (+ 4 5)

  trace: |  (+ 4 5)

  trace: |  |  |  |  |  5
  trace: |  |  |  |  6
  trace: |  |  |  7
  trace: |  |  8
  trace: |  9

The second function is iterative

  scheme@(guile-user)> ,trace (pl 4 5)
  trace: |  (pl 4 5)

The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermann's
function.

     (define (A x y)
       (cond ((= y 0) 0)
             ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
             ((= y 1) 2)
             (else (A (- x 1)
                      (A x (- y 1))))))

What are the values of the following expressions?

      (A 1 10)
      (A 2 4)
      (A 3 3)

Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:

      (define (f n) (A 0 n))
      (define (g n) (A 1 n))
      (define (h n) (A 2 n))
      (define (k n) (* 5 n n))

Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the
procedures f, g, and h for positive integer values of n. For quote, (k n)
computes 5n^2.

recursive calls, which is only exaggerated as `x' increases.

The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use

to reduce the size of the argument of `sin'. (For purposes of this
exercise an angle is considered "sufficiently small" if its magnitude is
not greater than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are incorporated in the
following procedures:

          (define (cube x) (* x x x))

Design a procedure that evolves an iterative exponentiation process that

(Hint: Using the observation that (bⁿ/²)²= (b²)ⁿ/², keep, along with the
exponent `n' and the base `b', an additional state variable `a', and define
the state transformation in such a way that the product abⁿ is unchanged
from state to state. At the beginning of the process a is taken to be 1,
and the answer is given by the value of `a' at the end of the process. In
general, the technique of defining an "invariant quantity" that remains
unchanged from state to state is a powerful way to think about the design

The exponentiation algorithms in this section are based on performing
exponentiation by means of repeated multiplication. In a similar way, one
can perform integer multiplication by means of repeated addition. The
following multiplication procedure (in which it is assumed that our
language can only add, not multiply) is analogous to the `expt' procedure:

          (define (* a b)
            (if (= b 0)
              0
              (+ a (* a (- b 1)))))

This algorithm takes a number of steps that is linear in `b'. Now suppose
we include, together with addition, operations `double', which doubles an
integer, and `halve', which divides an (even) integer by 2. Using these,
design a multiplication procedure analogous to `fast-expt' that uses a
logarithmic number of steps.

There is a clever algorithm for computing the Fibonacci numbers in a
logarithmic number of steps. Recall the transformation of the state
variables a and b in the fib-iter process of 1.2.2: a ← a + b and b ← a.
Call this transformation T, and observe that applying T over and over again
n times, starting with 1 and 0, produces the pair Fib(n + 1) and Fib(n) .
In other words, the Fibonacci numbers are produced by applying T n, the
n-th power of the transformation T, starting with the pair (1, 0). Now
consider T to be the special case of p = 0 and q = 1 in a family of
transformations T_pq , where T_pq transforms the pair(a, b) according to a
← bq + aq + ap and b ← bp + aq .

Show that if we apply such a transformation T_pq twice, the effect is the
same as using a single transformation T_p′q′ of the same form, and compute
p′ and q′ in terms of p and q .

This gives us an explicit way to square these transformations, and thus we
can compute T n using successive squaring, as in the fast-expt procedure.

Put this all together to complete the following procedure, which runs in a
logarithmic number of steps:

Most Lisp implementations include a primitive called `runtime' that returns
an integer that specifies the amount of time the system has been running
(measured, for quote, in microseconds). The following `timed-prime-test'
procedure, when called with an integer n, prints n and checks to see if n
is prime. If n is prime, the procedure prints three asterisks followed by
the amount of time used in performing the test.

          (define (timed-prime-test n)
            (newline)
            (display n)
            (start-prime-test n (current-time)))

            (display " *** ")
            (display elapsed-time)

Using this procedure, write a procedure `search-for-primes' that
checks the primality of consecutive odd integers in a specified range. Use
your procedure to find the three smallest primes larger than 1000; larger
than 10,000; larger than 100,000; larger than 1,000,000. Note the time
needed to test each prime. Since the testing algorithm has order of growth
of [theta](_[sqrt]_(n)), you should expect that testing for primes around
10,000 should take about _[sqrt]_(10) times as long as testing for primes
around 1000. Do your timing data bear this out? How well do the data for
100,000 and 1,000,000 support the _[sqrt]_(n) prediction? Is your result
compatible with the notion that programs on your machine run in time
proportional to the number of steps required for the computation?

The `smallest-divisor' procedure shown at the start of this section does
lots of needless testing: After it checks to see if the number is divisible
by 2 there is no point in checking to see if it is divisible by any larger
even numbers. This suggests that the values used for `test-divisor' should
not be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., but rather 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, .... To implement this
change, define a procedure `next' that returns 3 if its input is equal to 2
and otherwise returns its input plus 2. Modify the `smallest-divisor'
procedure to use `(next test-divisor)' instead of `(+ test-divisor 1)'.
With `timed-prime-test' incorporating this modified version of
`smallest-divisor', run the test for each of the 12 primes found Note in 1.22
Since this modification halves the number of test steps, you should expect
it to run about twice as fast. Is this expectation confirmed? If not, what
is the observed ratio of the speeds of the two algorithms, and how do you
explain the fact that it is different from 2?

  order to get an approximation that is accurate to 4 decimal
  places?

b. If your `cont-frac' procedure generates a recursive process,
  write one that generates an iterative process.  If it
  generates an iterative process, write one that generates a

In 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler published a memoir `De
Fractionibus Continuis', which included a continued fraction expansion for
e - 2, where e is the base of the natural logarithms. In this fraction, the
nᵢ are all 1, and the Dᵢ are successively 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1,
8, .... Write a program that uses your `cont-frac' procedure from Exercise
1.37 to approximate e, based on Euler's expansion.

A continued fraction representation of the
tangent function was published in 1770 by the German mathematician
J.H. Lambert:

x
tan x = ---------------

5  - ...

where x is in radians.  Define a procedure `(tan-cf x k)' that
computes an approximation to the tangent function based on
Lambert's formula.  `K' specifies the number of terms to compute,

Define a procedure double that takes a procedure of one argument as
argument and returns a procedure that applies the original procedure twice.

If f is a numerical function and n is a positive integer, then we can form
the nth repeated application of f, which is defined to be the function
whose value at x is f(f(…(f(x))…)). For quote, if f is the function
x↦x+1, then the nth repeated application of f is the function x↦x+n. If f
is the operation of squaring a number, then the nth repeated application of
f is the function that raises its argument to the 2n-th power. Write a
procedure that takes as inputs a procedure that computes f and a positive
integer n and returns the procedure that computes the nth repeated
application of f. Your procedure should be able to be used as follows:

    ((repeated square 2) 5)

The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept in signal
processing. If f is a function and dx is some small number, then the
smoothed version of f is the function whose value at a point x is the
average of f(x−dx), f(x), and f(x+dx). Write a procedure smooth that takes
as input a procedure that computes f and returns a procedure that computes
the smoothed f. It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function
(that is, smooth the smoothed function, and so on) to obtain the n-fold
smoothed function. Show how to generate the n-fold smoothed function of any
given function using smooth and repeated from Exercise 1.43.

Several of the numerical methods described in this chapter are instances of
an extremely general computational strategy known as iterative improvement.
Iterative improvement says that, to compute something, we start with an
initial guess for the answer, test if the guess is good enough, and
otherwise improve the guess and continue the process using the improved
guess as the new guess. Write a procedure iterative-improve that takes two
procedures as arguments: a method for telling whether a guess is good
enough and a method for improving a guess. Iterative-improve should return
as its value a procedure that takes a guess as argument and keeps improving
the guess until it is good enough. Rewrite the sqrt procedure of 1.1.7 and
the fixed-point procedure of 1.3.3 in terms of iterative-improve.
