I recieved this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check">Knuth reward check</a> for a remark I sent to Knuth about a to a
particular SAT-solving heuristic concerned with the selection of decision
literals, which has advanced the state of the art for the fairly obscure problem
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurifeuillean_factorization">Aurifeuillean factorization</a>, but with other implications for problems such as
'show that some adjacency-configuration of Knights on a Chess board always
results in a draw' or 'Find possible starting board states for a Game of Life,
which evolves to some configuration after 2<sup>16</sup> rounds'.
</p>

<p>
I don't have any formal background in the the topic of SMT and SAT solvers, but
I've taken a pretty earnest interest in them, steadily filling in background in
automated logic and satisfiability. I've written a <a href="file:///">solver of my own design</a> as
well as <a href="https://github.com/zv/z3-mode">an interactive development environment for SAT Solvers &amp; SMTLIBv2</a>.
</p>

<p>
Although they've been applied to an extraordinary number of problems in the
design of electronics, the rarefied air of automated reasoning tools in
line-of-business software is perceptibly evaporating. Both the extraordinary
pace of hardware along with the dependable churn of speed records at formal SAT
&amp; SMT performance 'contests' have allowed industrial engines of satisfiability
to realistically check properties of real-world software, which is giving the
first intimations of a major shift in static analysis &amp; the study of copy
protection.
</p>

<p>
I've personally used such solvers in the service of checking <i>real-world</i> code,
assisted me not only in finding, but also generating several 0day exploits (as
well of plenty of ordinary bugs) well-respected software (and even <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/1111">a language
runtime</a>).
