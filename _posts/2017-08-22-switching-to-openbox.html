<h2 id="org53c669a">Advantages</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org53c669a">
<p>
I've been satisfied with pure tiling window managers for the past decade, but
I recently used Openbox on a friends machine and I've instantly realized that
it was a better way.
</p>

<p>
I'm not ready to give up on the benefits of tiling entirely however and I've
tried to setup my workstation as a hybrid tiling/stacking setup which I've
described below.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org49aa139" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org49aa139">What is Openbox?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org49aa139">
<p>
Openbox is a stacking window manager that comes as part of the <a href="http://lxde.org/">LXDE desktop</a>.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to widely-used lightweight tiling window managers, LXDE comes
'opinionated' with a traditional menu and generally adheres to the desktop
metaphor found on OSX and Windows.
</p>

<p>
Openbox is primarily configured with an XML file that dictates both keyboard
and mouse bindings, while also allowing you to control window decoration,
defaults, etc.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3211d27" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3211d27">Menu</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3211d27">
<p>
Many larger Linux applications introduce a way to start their programs into a
"start menu", categorized by application 'type'. Menus eliminate the problem
of <i>unknown unknowns</i> - programs you've once installed but forgotten or came
included with another program you installed.
</p>

<p>
If you use a distribution which frequently integrates the newest changes in
Linux, sometimes you can miss new tooling if you don't have a menu which lists
all the installed graphical applications on your system. As a matter of using
Openbox, I found out that the firewall I've been configuring through a CLI for years
has an extremely sophisticated GUI - found through a menu entry.

<p>
It's possible to get a bar in any tiling window manager, but I'm partial to
<span class="verbatim">lxpanel</span>.
</p>

<p>
LXDE has gone to considerable lengths to preserve some degree of
compatibility with the interface guidelines and standards set forth by
organizations like the GNOME Project, which means you no longer need to get
inside of your <span class="verbatim">xinitrc</span> to start up the appropriate services.
</p>

<p>
Which brings me to the final point.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge2dd89b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge2dd89b">It's Complicated</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge2dd89b">
<p>
From <span class="verbatim">abrt</span> to <span class="verbatim">libnotify</span>, there's a lot of stuff under the hood of a modern
desktop.
</p>

<p>
If you want to go the <i>"lightweight"</i> route, you've got to prepare yourself
for quite a bit. You'll need to install and configure a notification daemon,
you'll need to make sure to start NetworkManager, <span class="verbatim">abrt</span>. You'll need to test
to make sure that <span class="verbatim">secon</span> notifications are getting triggered in the event
that SELinux wants to let you know something is amiss. You'll need to have
keybindings for handling <code>🔊</code> and <code>🔇</code>, not to mention the host of other
specialized keys on a modern keyboard. Using existing tooling from a
configuration panel like <span class="verbatim">gnome-control-center</span> will occassionally fail for
important pieces of your system like monitors and bluetooth.
</p>

<p>
Yes, you can write the dunst configuration, you can use <span class="verbatim">xrandr</span>, configure
your keys, write the unit file to accommodate <span class="verbatim">gnome-keyring-daemon</span>, along with
the shell protocol. You can dive through poorly documented code that doesn't really
contain any special insights into computers.
</p>

<p>
There's something vaguely neat about learning the details of all this. I did
it and I have a large <a href="https://github.com/zv/dotfilez">dotfiles repo</a> that bears witness to this vast network
of rc files, <span class="verbatim">$XDG_CONFIG</span> and shell scripts I've assembled over the past
decade.
</p>

<p>
I'm ready for another way however.

<h2 id="org19787b8">The Setup</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org19787b8">
<p>
If you want to directly use my configuration, you can find my openbox
configuration <a href="https://github.com/zv/dotfilez/blob/master/rc/lxde-rc.xml">here</a>
</p>

<p>
I use the symbol "<span class="verbatim">🗔</span>" below to mean <i>Super</i> (also known as the 'Windows' key).

<h3 id="org3a616bb">Desktops</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3a616bb">
<p>
LXDE includes the concept of a <i>desktop</i>, a workspace that isolates the
windows from each other.
</p>

<p>
I maintain 8 desktops, each bound to one of the keys above the home row, with
the final <span class="verbatim">p</span> key used to invoke <a href="http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a>.
</p>

<p>
Typically, I keep a particular application associated with each desktop like
the following. This allows switching between unrelated applications like
emacs and slack very quickly.

A desktop typically has one application ("window"), but more can be split
into a number of adjacent windows, toggled between horizontal &amp; vertical
splits (as well as returned to full-screen configuration).
</p>

<p>
Windows each have 'focus', which refers to which application recieved input
when keys are pressed on the keyboard. Both position &amp; window focus can be
switched with the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">Vi</a> HJKL keybindings described below.

<p>
Pressing shift with any of these keys causes your currently focused window
to be swapped with the window in the direction you specified.
</p>

<p>
For example, <code>🗔-Shift-o</code> moves the currently focused window to the <span class="verbatim">o</span>
desktop.
</p>

<p>
For example, this is a desktop that begins with a window 'documentation' and
a focused window 'terminal' (indicated by <span class="verbatim">[</span> and <span class="verbatim">]</span>)

<p>
Pressing <code>🗔-Shift-h</code> swaps their position.

The most important final key is <code>🗔-p</code> which runs dmenu.
</p>

<p>
dmenu (<i>"dynamic menu"</i>) autocompletes system binaries and invokes them when
⏎ is hit.
</p>

<p>
If I wanted to spawn <span class="verbatim">google-chrome</span>, I might type in <span class="verbatim">goo</span> and dmenu would
show something like the following.
</p>

<p>
I could hit ⏎ (return) and Chrome would start, I could also select other
binaries with left/right keys as well.
